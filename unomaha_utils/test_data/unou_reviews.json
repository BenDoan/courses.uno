            "improvement": "Her lectures are not the cream of the crop.  Be prepared to take notes all class period, every class period.  The notes that she gives you are thrown up on the board and the students are left to decifer what things are important enough to write down.  Also, there is no structure to her notes.  While most teachers use roman numerals or some sort of organizational tactic, she does not.  This is her biggest downfall, and in my opinion, a large area of concern."

She is very nice (though ditzy), but SHE CANNOT TEACH.\nIf you have a problem or question regarding the assignments, she won't be able to guide you to the right answer.  Instead she just gives you the right answer.  Pretty cool, but you don't learn anything.  Tests are hard though because they're Bob Fulkerson's tests and are far beyond the level she's at.  Everything will balance out in your favor at the end cuz she's a pushover.  She's a fairly  easy A, but if you have to go on and take more c++ than DON'T TAKE HER.  Because you don't learn a thing.  \nOne other thing...I hope you like Justin Timberlake (you'll understand if you take her class)."

She no longer does journals and no longer give extra credit this year. Please please please heed my warning and save yourself the worry of bringing down your gpa. Like people say she is a sweet lady and genuinly caring, but unorganized.",

The class seems easy when you sign up for it, but Dando's teaching style makes it difficult for over half of the students to pass. Right now the class average is a D as far as the grade statistics on black board."
